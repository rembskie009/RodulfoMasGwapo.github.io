<h3>Kousie Arima</h3>	
<p>Kousei Arima (有馬 公生 Arima Kousei?) is the main protagonist of the Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso series.
Kousei is a piano player and was the youngest pianist ever to win the Saki Competition. However, he stopped playing after the death of his mother. His mother's death resulted in his inability to hear the pieces he plays. Following the death of his mother, he lived for two years without playing the piano and saw the world in monochrome. But this changes after meeting Kaori Miyazono, a young violinist who pushes Kousei to his limits in an attempt to get his fingers back onto the piano keys.
Kousei became a piano player at the encouragement of his mother's friend, Hiroko Seto, after Kousei recreated an improvised song that Hiroko was playing towards her husband. This led to his mother becoming his mentor and teaching him how to play.
Following a collapse in his mother's health, Kousei's style of learning to play the piano was drastically changed, As a result, Kousei started becoming distant from his friends and focused solely on perfecting his piano skills in an attempt to satisfy his mother and make her happy.</p>

She has long yellow hair and blue eyes, making her look as a foreigner. Following her hospitalization, Kaori's hair and skin color began to fade into a duller hue. She is also considered very beautiful,Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her personality. She is often friendly and encouraging. Kaori has many interests, However one thing that remained constant after meeting Kousei when they were younger was her passion for the violin. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others. She always puts up a smile in front of others, regardless of how she feels, to avoid her friends worrying about her.While considered a great violinist from a theoretical perspective, she often eschews details of the score and its historical and traditional interpretations. One of the judges at Towa Hall, during the first competition of the series, noted that her abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free-spirited style of performance that emphasized emotion and artistry over strict interpretation of the score and the composer's intent. Her music inspired Kousei to regain his passion for the piano and redefine himself as a musician.</p>

<h3>Tsubaki Wasabe</h3>
<p>Tsubaki Sawabe (澤部 椿 Sawabe Tsubaki?)Tsubaki is very supportive, always willing to help out her friends in their troubles. She can also be seen defensive of her female friends, as she was upset when Watari dumped one of them. She is also adventurous, sometimes to the point of doing dangerous things. She also is very outgoing. Though, despite her calm and kind nature, Tsubaki is easily angered. In her childhood, when Kousei was learning the piano and was never able to go out to play with her, she would often make things for him and reassured him when his mother got rid of his cat he had found. She is seen as very tomboyish, having short hair and being a fan of sports. Many of her classmates called her creepy because of her personality and looks, leading her into thinking that about herself. She was also thought of as oblivious to her own feelings. Seen when she started to like Kousei, her best friend knew it all along and even dropped hints, such as the fact that she was always talking about him, worrying about him and watching out for him. For example when Kousei was injured, Tsubaki was willing to carry Kousei on her back, despite being hurt herself. Also Watari and Kaori knew her feelings for Kousei but, didn't say anything.
Tsubaki secretly likes Kousei but does not possess the courage to confess to him. She had a hard time realizing her own feelings. She tries to hide her real emotions with a smile but cries throughout the series because of emotional outbursts. She can also be seen as selfish because she worries that music will take Kousei from her. Despite this, Tsubaki is kind and caring. She cares about Kousei enough to pick a high school near his so she can still see him and be there by his side.</p>

<h3>Ryota Watari</h3>

His hair is a medium length and is slightly swept to the right, causing him to look easygoing and approachable. He is known for being good looking, which he uses to his advantage. Watari is the average height for a junior high student his age. He has an average build and is also quite lean. His uniform is to be pictured slightly disheveled, with his tie loose around his neck and his shirt not being tucked in, making girls swoon for him.Watari is a bit of a play-boy. He seems to prefer girls who are "cute" seen as he comments in episode 1 that when he sees Kaori for the first time he stated that Tsubaki did a good job on finding a cute looking girl. Furthermore, when introduced to Hiroko Seto, he talks to her immediately, calling her "Onee-sama" and telling Kousei that she's cute. Watari also seems chill on the outside shown when he loses the last game of his middle school career and comforts his team mate. Really Watari is fragile. He also supports his friends as shown when Arima confesses to Watari. Watari tells Arima that it is up to the girl to decide whether you are worth it or not. He supports Arima falling in love with Kaori even though he quite likes her.</p>
